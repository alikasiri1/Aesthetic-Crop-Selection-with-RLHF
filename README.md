# Aesthetic-Crop-Selection-with-RLHF
explores automatic image cropping and composition by combining a pre-trained NIMA model with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The system uses NIMA to score candidate crops and then refines its selection policy through human-aligned reinforcement learning, aiming to produce visually appealing images without manual labeling.
